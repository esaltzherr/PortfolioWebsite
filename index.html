        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Elroy Saltzherr, a recent graduate from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in Computer Science: Game Design, currently based in California. My passion for gaming started in childhood, and after learning to program, game development naturally became my focus.</p>
        <p>I've dedicated thousands of hours to games like Minecraft, League of Legends, Pok√©mon, and Mario. Besides gaming, I've participated in various sports such as basketball, baseball, and soccer, with soccer being my longest commitment, spanning 15 years. I also spent my entire high school career in competitive robotics, which honed my problem-solving and teamwork skills.</p>
        <p>These experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in technical skills and a passion for creating immersive, engaging games. I'm excited to continue honing my craft and contributing to the gaming industry.</p>

            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> After learning from my previous game jam, I focused on keeping the game simple. Although I couldn't dedicate as much time as I wanted during the 96 hours, the game turned out to be an interesting idea that I would like to explore further, possibly as a multiplayer game. It's fun, but it needs some polish.</p>
