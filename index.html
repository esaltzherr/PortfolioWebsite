        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Elroy Saltzherr, a recent graduate from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in Computer Science Game
            Design, and currently based in California. My passion for gaming began in childhood, and when I learned to
            program, game development naturally became my focus.</p>
        <p>I've dedicated thousands of hours to games like Minecraft, League of Legends, Pok√©mon, and Mario. In addition
            to gaming, I've engaged in various sports, including basketball, baseball, and soccer, with soccer being my
            largest commitment, spanning 15 years. I also spent my entire high school career in competitive robotics,
            honing my problem-solving and teamwork skills.</p>
        <p>These experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in technical skills and a passion for creating
            immersive, engaging games. I'm excited to continue developing my craft and contributing to the gaming
            industry.</p>
